# universe.sql - Relational Database Project: "Celestial Bodies" - Freecodecamp Course
This repository is an implementation exercise as part of the [FreeCodeCamp Relational Database Certification] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/). Design, structure and syntaxis of the script were guided and provided by FreeCodeCamp, while the content and data were chosen and created by me to enhance my skills in database management and analysis.

## Purpose of the exercise
Creating a celestial bodies database (.sql) with multiple interconnected tables (at least 4), linked through primary and foreign keys, to facilitate efficient querying. The main celestial bodies mandatory to be included in the database were galaxies, stars, planets and moons.

## Tools used
- PostgreSQL
- VS Code

## My contribution
Populated the database with realistic data from various online sources about celestial bodies including detailed and intriguing information such as age, location, composition (e.g., water, gas, terrestrial), distance from Earth, presence of nearby black holes, and other characteristics.
